## Introduction

In this project I will be reproducing the main finding of the paper, that is the effect of cognitive load on moral decision making. Greene et al, present 40 vignettes of moral decisions that require either deontological (rule based) decisions or utilitarian (consequence based) decisions. While there is no difference in response time (RT) for either, with the presence of load, utilitarian responses have a longer RT. The study is a within-between design so all participants are in both no load and load groups and the RT is taken and averaged by judgement (deontolgical/utilitarian). 

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  The main finding that I am looking to replicate is the effect of load on RT for utilitarian decision making. 

### Justification for choice of study

I choose to replicate this study as it's a seminal piece that provides justification for thinking that utilitarian decision making is part of a slower cognitive process. This piece builds on previous work by Greene and will become a key finding for their work in model-free, model based moral decision making. 

### Anticipated challenges

One challenge I anticipate in attempting to replicate this study is getting sufficient responses from participants as there are many vinnettes and I could imagine that there will be a great deal of satisficing.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. 

### Differences from original study

One major difference is that I will be conducting this study online rather than in person. This means my population will not be Princton undergraduates and may represent more diversity in age and other demographics. This may have a role in how people make moral decisions as well as things like reading speed and general response time.

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

Unfortunately we were unsuccessful in reproducing the original paper's findings. 

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
