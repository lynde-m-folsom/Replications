If you have questions about this research, please contact us at stanfordpsych251@gmail.com. You must be at least 18 years old to participate. Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may decline to answer any or all of the following questions. You may decline further participation, at any time, without adverse consequences. Your anonymity is assured; the researchers who have requested your participation will not receive any personal information about you.","General instructions



In this experiment, you will read through 40 moral dilemmas. You will simply have to read the text aloud and respond to the question at the end of the dilemma. At the end of each paragraph, you will be asked whether or not it is morally acceptable to perform the described action. At this point you must respond by pressing one of two buttons (yes it is morally acceptable, no it is not morally acceptable) to indicate your answer. Please be aware some of these dilemmas contain graphic descriptions that some may find disturbing.



Moral judgments can be difficult to make, and we understand that people sometimes change their minds about moral questions or feel conflicted about the answers they're given. Don't think of your answers as ""written in stone."" All we want from you is a thoughtful first response. While we want your answers to be thoughtful, you may find that in some cases the right answer seems immediately obvious. If that happens, it's okay to answer quickly.



There are no trick questions or wrong answers, and in every case we have done our best to make the relevant information as clear as possible. 



Note, however, that no two questions are the same, although many questions are similar to each other. To answer a question properly you will have to read it carefully because it will always be different in some way from the questions you have already answered. When you are done with this screen you will see the directions for the first section.
 

Please read them carefully and then begin the survey by selecting ""ready to begin"" below.

In another room there are seven patients.  If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths.

The only way to save these patients is to hit a certain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room containing the three people.  As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room containing the seven patients, causing their deaths.

Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"You work for the Bureau of Health, a government agency.  You are deciding whether or not your agency should encourage the use of a certain recently developed vaccine.  The vast majority of people who take the vaccine develop an immunity to a certain deadly disease, but a very small number of people who take the vaccine will actually get the disease that the vaccine is designed to prevent.

All the available evidence, which is very strong, suggests that the chances of getting the disease due to lack of vaccination are much higher than the chances of getting the disease by taking the vaccine.

The scenarios were described well, and were easy to understand. It was really hard to keep reading aloud though. I did make it to the end by reading aloud at very high speed, jumping over small words, and switched to whispering for the last few when I got tired, but if I didn't know you personally and know that you specifically asked to read aloud, I'm not sure I would have been able to keep it up till the end. Is it possible to make each question stay on the screen for a minimum amount of time so the participant knows that rushing would be pointless? Don't know how to calculate the lower limit of time for reading aloud across all people though. Alternatively, you could tell people at the beginning something like ""this study takes x minutes and you will be anyway unable to submit the last page until that time is over, so please take as much time as you need to read the questions aloud"". But maybe that would change the survey too much..."
